# EasyEngine
An experimental cross-platform game engine created for personal and educational purposes

## TODO
### Rendering
- ~~Event driven render lifecycle~~
- ~~3D Mesh rendering~~
- 2D shape rendering
- ~~Basic materials~~
- ~~Basic textures~~
- Support normal maps
- Support displacement maps
- PBR
- SSAO
- Basic shadow mapping

### Physics
- Multi-threaded physics
- Add built-in `PhysicsComponent`
- Support collisions using `bulletphysics/bullet3`
- Add forces to `PhysicsComponent`

### Logging
- ~~Support consistent core and client logging~~
- Support logging to file

### ECS
- ~~Basic template based ECS~~
- ~~Support multiple component combinations per system~~
- Ensure memory locality of ECS components

### User Input
- ~~Emit events for keyboard and mouse input~~
- Support repeated keys

### Events
- ~~Basic event system~~
- ~~Support sync and async built-in events~~
- Support custom client events
- Support non-async custom client events

### Model loading
- ~~Basic support of common scene/model formats (meshes, textures and materials)~~
- Load normal maps
- Load displacement maps
- Load bones
- Load skeletal animations (depends on loading bones)

### Build
- Add premake configuration
- Support OSX builds
